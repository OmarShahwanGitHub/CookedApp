Context
This is an Expo + React Native mobile app generated initially by Rork. I want to turn it into a clean, production-ready Expo app. You have access to the full repo.

Your role
Act as a senior React Native / Expo engineer. Make repo-wide changes where necessary. Prefer stability and simplicity over cleverness.

1. Fix dependency & build issues (highest priority)

Resolve all dependency conflicts so the app runs on:

Expo Go on iOS

Android emulator (if available)

Fix the zod/v4, lucide-react-native, and React peer dependency issues.

If needed:

Downgrade React to a compatible version

Pin package versions explicitly

Remove or replace incompatible packages from @rork-ai/toolkit-sdk

The goal: npx expo start works without errors

Document what you changed and why.

2. Clean up the Rork-generated structure

Keep useful UI and screens

Remove unused Rork abstractions if they add complexity

Ensure:

Clear /screens, /components, /services structure

No hidden magic or auto-generated SDK behavior

3. Implement recipe ingestion & parsing pipeline
User inputs:

Recipe URL

Pasted text

Image upload (photo of recipe)

Architecture:

Create a recipeParsingService

This service should:

Accept raw input

Send it to an LLM (Claude or GPT)

Receive structured JSON:

title

ingredients (editable)

step-by-step instructions (simple, beginner-friendly)

Do NOT hardcode any API keys

Read API keys from environment variables later

4. Core app features to implement
Required:

Editable grocery list

Checkbox for “already have this”

Saved recipe library

Categories (e.g. pasta, vegetarian, pizza)

“Saved” vs “Cooked” state

Calendar/reminder feature

Lightweight (local notifications is fine)

Explicitly do NOT add:

Social features

Public feeds

Recipe ebook uploads

5. RevenueCat integration

Implement RevenueCat with the following logic:

Free tier:

Max 10 saved recipes

When user hits the limit:

Show a paywall screen

Subscription unlocks:

Unlimited recipes

Use RevenueCat SDK for Expo / React Native

Authentication:

Anonymous users allowed

Upgrade on subscription

Do NOT hardcode RevenueCat keys. Assume they come from env config.

6. Platform readiness

Ensure app works on:

iOS (Expo Go / TestFlight-ready)

Android (Play Store–ready)

Avoid web-only libraries

Avoid Node-only APIs

7. Output expectations

Make code changes directly in the repo

Add comments where non-obvious

Leave a short README section explaining:

How to run locally

Where to add API keys

How monetization works

Primary goal
A stable Expo app that runs on a real phone, parses recipes cleanly, and enforces a RevenueCat paywall after 10 recipes.
