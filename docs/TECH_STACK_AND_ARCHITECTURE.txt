Cooked App — Tech Stack, Architecture & RevenueCat

This document describes the technology stack, application
architecture, and RevenueCat subscription implementation for the
Cooked recipe management app.


TECH STACK

Client (Mobile & Web)

  Layer: Framework
  Technology: Expo ~54 (React Native)

  Layer: Routing
  Technology: expo-router ~6 (file-based, typed routes)

  Layer: UI
  Technology: React 19, React Native 0.81, lucide-react-native icons

  Layer: State
  Technology: Zustand ^5, @tanstack/react-query ^5

  Layer: Persistence
  Technology: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

  Layer: Subscriptions
  Technology: react-native-purchases (RevenueCat SDK) ^8.2

  Layer: AI / Parsing
  Technology: OpenAI ^6 — configurable with Anthropic/Gemini via env
  (see services/recipeParser.ts)

  Layer: Media
  Technology: expo-image-picker, expo-image-manipulator, expo-image

  Layer: Other
  Technology: expo-notifications, expo-haptics, expo-blur,
  expo-linear-gradient, expo-web-browser, expo-dev-client

• Platforms: iOS, Android, Web. RevenueCat and some native features
  are iOS/Android only; web runs with graceful fallbacks.

• Build: EAS Build (see eas.json). RevenueCat requires a custom
  development build (not Expo Go) for real purchase behavior.

Backend (Video Parsing)

  Layer: Runtime
  Technology: Node.js

  Layer: Server
  Technology: Express ^5

  Layer: Video
  Technology: fluent-ffmpeg (audio extraction)

  Layer: Transcription
  Technology: Backend uses its own transcription/recipe parsing
  (see server/transcribe.js, server/recipeParse.js)

  Layer: YouTube
  Technology: Custom caption fetch + optional audio transcription

• Deployment: Standalone service; configurable via
  EXPO_PUBLIC_VIDEO_BACKEND_URL (or Metro/debugger host in dev).
  Not part of the Expo app bundle.

Development & Tooling

• Language: TypeScript (client), JavaScript (server)
• Linting: ESLint with eslint-config-expo
• Env: Values are set in a .env file (local) or in EAS environment
  variables (production). Expo inlines EXPO_PUBLIC_* at build time.


ARCHITECTURE

High-Level Structure

  CookedApp/
    app/                    (expo-router screens)
      _layout.tsx           Root: QueryClient, GestureHandler,
                            RecipeProvider, subscription init
      (tabs)/               Tab navigator: Home, Grocery, Library
      add-recipe.tsx        Modal: add recipe flow, paywall gate
      recipe/[id].tsx       Recipe detail
    components/             Reusable UI (e.g. PaywallScreen,
                            RecipeCard, EmptyState)
    context/                RecipeContext (recipes CRUD + persistence)
    services/               subscriptionService, recipeParser,
                            inputNormalizer
    utils/                  parseRecipe (orchestrates text/image/
                            video parsing)
    constants/              colors, categories
    types/                  Recipe and related types
    server/                 Standalone video parsing backend
                            (Express)

Data & State

• Recipes: Stored in AsyncStorage under a single key; loaded/saved
  via React Query (queryKey: ['recipes']) and synced in
  RecipeContext with syncRecipes mutation. No backend database; all
  recipe state is local.

• Subscription state: Not stored in AsyncStorage. Determined on
  demand via RevenueCat SDK (getCustomerInfo(), entitlements).
  Cached in memory by the SDK.

Recipe Parsing Pipeline

1. Text / URL (article): parseRecipe → normalizeInputToText
   (fetch URL if needed) → parseRecipeFromText in recipeParser.ts
   (AI: OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini via env keys).

2. Image: parseRecipe → parseRecipeFromImages (vision API) in
   recipeParser.ts.

3. Video: parseRecipe → parseVideoViaBackend in utils/parseRecipe.ts
   → HTTP POST /parse-video to the Node server → server uses
   YouTube captions and/or audio transcription + recipe parsing
   (see server/parseVideo.js, server/recipeParse.js).

Paywall Gate (Add Recipe)

• When the user tries to save a new recipe in add-recipe.tsx, the
  app calls canAddRecipe(recipes.length) from subscriptionService.

• Free limit: 10 recipes (constant FREE_RECIPE_LIMIT in
  subscriptionService.ts).

• If the user is at or over the limit and not entitled,
  canAddRecipe returns false and the add-recipe screen shows
  PaywallScreen instead of saving.

• After a successful purchase or restore, the UI calls
  onSubscribed() and the user can save the recipe.

Navigation

• Root: Stack (expo-router) with tabs, add-recipe (modal), and
  recipe detail.

• Tabs: Home, Grocery, Library (each with its own layout/screen
  under app/(tabs)/).


REVENUECAT IMPLEMENTATION

Overview

• Role: Cross-platform in-app purchases and subscription state
  (e.g. "premium" entitlement).

• SDK: react-native-purchases (RevenueCat). Configured once at app
  startup; used for offerings, purchase, restore, and entitlement
  checks.

• Platform support: RevenueCat is not available on web (no native
  StoreKit/Play Billing). On web, getPurchases() returns null and
  the app skips configure/purchase/restore and shows a message to
  configure the API key.

Configuration

• API key: Read from process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY or
  process.env.REVENUECAT_API_KEY (see getRevenueCatApiKey() in
  services/subscriptionService.ts). Set in .env for local/dev and
  in EAS environment variables for production. Use the iOS public
  API key (e.g. appl_...) for iOS builds.

• Initialization: initializeSubscriptions() is called from
  app/_layout.tsx on app load. It configures the RevenueCat SDK
  with the API key; if the key is missing or configure fails, the
  rest of the app still runs (no purchases).

Entitlements & Limits

• Entitlement identifier: premium. Subscribed if
  customerInfo.entitlements.active['premium'] is defined (see
  checkSubscriptionStatus(), purchasePackage(), restorePurchases()).

• Free tier: 10 recipes. Subscribers get unlimited (logic in
  checkSubscriptionStatus() and canAddRecipe()).

Main APIs Used

  Purpose: App startup
  Service function: initializeSubscriptions()
  RevenueCat usage: purchases.configure({ apiKey })

  Purpose: Can user add recipe?
  Service function: canAddRecipe(currentRecipeCount)
  RevenueCat usage: Uses checkSubscriptionStatus() → getCustomerInfo(),
  then compares count to limit

  Purpose: Subscription status
  Service function: checkSubscriptionStatus()
  RevenueCat usage: getCustomerInfo(), check
  entitlements.active['premium']

  Purpose: Paywall offerings
  Service function: getOfferings()
  RevenueCat usage: getOfferings() →
  offerings.current.availablePackages

  Purpose: Purchase
  Service function: purchasePackage(pkg)
  RevenueCat usage: purchasePackage(pkg) → check
  customerInfo.entitlements.active['premium']

  Purpose: Restore
  Service function: restorePurchases()
  RevenueCat usage: restorePurchases() → same entitlement check

Paywall UI

• Component: components/PaywallScreen.tsx.

• Props: onDismiss, onSubscribed. Used inside the add-recipe modal
  when the user is over the free limit.

• Behavior: Loads packages via getOfferings() and shows them as
  buttons (title + price). "Restore Purchases" calls
  restorePurchases() and then onSubscribed() if an active
  subscription is found. If no packages are available, shows a
  message that depends on isRevenueCatConfigured() (e.g. "create
  products in App Store Connect and add them to an offering in the
  RevenueCat dashboard" vs "add EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY").
  Debug text from getLastOfferingsDebug() can be shown to help with
  missing offerings (e.g. no current offering, no packages, or
  RevenueCat errors).

Setup Checklist (RevenueCat + App Store)

1. RevenueCat project: Create project, add iOS app, link App Store
   Connect (e.g. API key / in-app purchases).

2. App Store Connect: Create subscription product(s) (e.g.
   com.cooked.recipe.pro_monthly), attach to app.

3. RevenueCat dashboard: Create an offering (e.g. "default"), add
   package(s) that reference the App Store product(s), set
   "default" as Current offering.

4. App: Set EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY (iOS public key) in .env
   or EAS env.

5. Build: Use a development build (EAS or local) so the native
   RevenueCat/StoreKit code runs; Expo Go only runs RevenueCat in
   "Preview" mode (no real purchases).

Privacy & Third-Party

• Payment and subscription state are handled by Apple (and
  RevenueCat). The app does not store payment details.

• Privacy site and support pages reference RevenueCat for
  subscription management and link to RevenueCat's privacy policy:

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (SUMMARY)

Client app (Expo). Set these in a .env file in the project root for
local development, or in EAS (Expo Application Services) environment
variables for production/TestFlight builds. Use the exact names
below; the app reads them at build time (EXPO_PUBLIC_*) or runtime
where applicable.

  Variable: EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY
  Where: Client
  Purpose: RevenueCat SDK. Use your iOS public API key from the
  RevenueCat dashboard (typically starts with appl_...) for iOS
  production builds. Required for in-app purchases and paywall.

  Variable: EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY
  Where: Client
  Purpose: OpenAI API key for AI recipe parsing (text and vision).
  The app uses one of OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini depending on
  which key(s) you set.

  Variable: EXPO_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  Where: Client
  Purpose: Anthropic API key for AI recipe parsing (alternative to
  OpenAI/Gemini). The app uses one of OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini
  depending on which key(s) you set.

  Variable: EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY
  Where: Client
  Purpose: Google Gemini API key for AI recipe parsing (alternative
  to OpenAI/Anthropic). The app uses one of OpenAI, Anthropic, or
  Gemini depending on which key(s) you set.

  Variable: EXPO_PUBLIC_VIDEO_BACKEND_URL
  Where: Client
  Purpose: Base URL of the video parsing server. For local dev you
  can leave this unset (the app will try Metro/debugger host or
  localhost). For TestFlight or production, deploy the video backend
  somewhere (e.g. Railway, Heroku) and set this to that URL, e.g.:
  https://your-video-backend.example.com

Server (video parsing backend). Set these where the Node server
runs; they are not part of the Expo app.

  Variable: PORT or VIDEO_BACKEND_PORT
  Where: Server
  Purpose: Port the video parsing server listens on (e.g. 3001).
  Used by the Node backend only.

  Other server env: The video backend may use additional
  environment variables for transcription or other services (see the
  server’s own documentation or README). Those are configured only
  on the machine or host running the Node server.
