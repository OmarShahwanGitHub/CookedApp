**How to find the in-app purchase (Cooked Pro Monthly) in the app**

1. Open the app and go to the main recipe list (home).
2. Tap the **"+" (Add Recipe)** button (bottom-right or in the header, depending on layout).
3. Add recipes using any method (e.g. paste recipe text and tap **Parse Recipe**, or add a link/image/video and parse) until you have added **10 recipes** and saved them. The app allows up to 10 recipes for free users.
4. When you try to add an **11th recipe** (e.g. paste text and tap Parse Recipe, or after parsing when you tap Save), the **paywall** appears. The paywall shows the **Cooked Pro Monthly** subscription option.
5. The subscription can be tested in the **Apple Sandbox** environment. We have accepted the Paid Apps Agreement in the Business section of App Store Connect, and the in-app purchase is configured for sandbox review.

If the paywall does not appear, please ensure you are using a sandbox tester account and that the device is not already in an active sandbox subscription state for this app.

**Optional shorter version**

To locate the in-app purchase: Tap "+" (Add Recipe), add and save 10 recipes (e.g. paste text → Parse Recipe → Save). When you add an 11th recipe, the paywall appears with Cooked Pro Monthly. Subscriptions are available for testing in the Apple Sandbox environment.
