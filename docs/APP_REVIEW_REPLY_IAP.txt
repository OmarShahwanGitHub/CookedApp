How to find the in-app purchase (Cooked Pro Monthly) in the app

1. Open the app and go to the main recipe list (home).
2. Tap the "+" (Add Recipe) button (bottom-right or in the header, depending on layout).
3. Add recipes using any method (e.g. paste recipe text and tap Parse Recipe, or add a link/image/video and parse) until you have added 10 recipes and saved them. The app allows up to 10 recipes for free users.
4. When you try to add an 11th recipe (e.g. paste text and tap Parse Recipe, or after parsing when you tap Save), the paywall appears. The paywall shows the Cooked Pro Monthly subscription option.
5. The subscription can be tested in the Apple Sandbox environment. We have accepted the Paid Apps Agreement in the Business section of App Store Connect, and the in-app purchase is configured for sandbox review.

If the paywall does not appear, please ensure you are using a sandbox tester account and that the device is not already in an active sandbox subscription state for this app.
