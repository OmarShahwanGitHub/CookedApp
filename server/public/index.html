  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Cooked Recipe App · Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <p>This privacy policy describes how Cooked Recipe App ("we", "the app") handles information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>Information stored on your device</h2>
  <p>Recipes you save, your grocery list, and app preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not run our own servers that store your recipe content. This data stays on your device unless you delete the app or clear its data.</p>

  <h2>Information we process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recipe parsing:</strong> When you paste text, a link, an image, or a video URL to add a recipe, that content may be sent to third-party AI and transcription services (such as Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google) to extract recipe details. We do not use this content for advertising or to build profiles about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> If you subscribe to Cooked Pro, purchase and subscription status are handled by Apple and RevenueCat. We do not receive or store your payment details. RevenueCat's privacy policy applies to that processing: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>We use the following types of services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple (App Store, in-app purchases, optional push notifications)</li>
    <li>RevenueCat (subscription management)</li>
    <li>AI and transcription providers (for recipe and, where used, video/audio processing)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each provider has its own privacy policy. We only send the minimum data needed for the feature (e.g. recipe text or image for parsing, or identifiers for subscriptions).</p>

  <h2>Data we do not sell</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information or recipe content to third parties.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will change when we do. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or the app, see our <a href="support.html">Support</a> page for contact details.</p>
