  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Cooked Recipe App · Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>This privacy policy describes how Cooked Recipe App ("we", "the app") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>Information stored on your device</h2>
  <p>Recipes you save, your grocery list, and app preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not run our own servers that store your recipe content. This data stays on your device unless you delete the app or clear its data.</p>

  <h2>Data we collect and how we collect it</h2>
  <p>We collect and process the following only when you use specific features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recipe parsing (text, link, image, or video):</strong> When you paste recipe text, enter a URL, add a photo, or provide a video URL and tap to parse, we send that content to third-party AI and transcription services so they can extract ingredients and steps. We collect this data only at the moment you choose to parse; we do not continuously collect or store the content you paste or the URLs you enter for other purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> If you subscribe to Cooked Pro, purchase and subscription status are handled by Apple and RevenueCat. We do not receive or store your payment details. We receive only subscription status (e.g. active/canceled) from RevenueCat. RevenueCat's privacy policy applies to that processing: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who we send data to and how it is used</h2>
  <p><strong>Recipe content (text, URLs, images, video URLs)</strong> is sent to the following third-party providers solely to extract recipe information (ingredients and steps):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> (Claude) – <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> (GPT) – <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Google</strong> (Gemini / transcription) – <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We use only the extracted recipe result (title, ingredients, steps) inside the app. We do not use your recipe content for advertising, marketing, or building profiles about you. We do not sell your data. Each of these providers has its own privacy policy and commitments to data protection; we rely on them to provide the same or equal protection for the data we send as described in their policies.</p>

  <h2>Your consent</h2>
  <p>Before we send any recipe content to a third-party AI service, the app will ask for your permission and explain what data is sent and to whom. Parsing only proceeds after you agree.</p>

  <h2>Other third-party services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple</strong> – App Store, in-app purchases, optional push notifications (subject to Apple’s privacy policy).</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> – Subscription management (see link above).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We only send the minimum data needed for each feature (e.g. recipe content for parsing, identifiers for subscriptions).</p>

  <h2>Data we do not sell</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information or recipe content to third parties.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will change when we do. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or the app, see our <a href="support.html">Support</a> page for contact details.</p>
